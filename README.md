Official code repository for the paper "Graph Distance Based on Cause-Effect Estimands with Latents" 

## Code Description
The main code is in the folder `src`. There are two example scripts for using FID.
- `run_single.py`: runs FID for a given treatment-effect pair on two ADMG.
- `run_all_pairs.py`: runs FID for all pairs on two ADMG (the default setting).
